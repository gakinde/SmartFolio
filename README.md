## SmartFolio

* * * * *

### Introduction

I have designed **SmartFolio**, a state-of-the-art smart contract for automated investment portfolio management and asset rebalancing on the Stacks blockchain. This contract provides a secure, transparent, and efficient way to manage decentralized investment portfolios. By leveraging predefined allocation strategies, real-time market data, and on-chain analytics, SmartFolio automates the complex process of asset management, ensuring portfolios stay aligned with their target allocations and risk tolerance levels. It's a foundational tool for building sophisticated, autonomous financial applications in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

### Features

-   **Automated Portfolio Rebalancing**: The `trigger-rebalance` function allows a portfolio owner to rebalance their portfolio to its target allocation. The contract is designed to eventually automate this process based on pre-set conditions, such as drift from target allocation or time intervals.

-   **Flexible Portfolio Creation**: The `create-portfolio` function enables users to define their investment strategy, risk tolerance, and initial asset allocations. It supports different strategies like **CONSERVATIVE**, **BALANCED**, and **AGGRESSIVE**.

-   **Comprehensive Performance Tracking**: The `portfolio-performance` map and the advanced analytics function track key metrics such as **initial value**, **current value**, **total return**, and **rebalance count**. This provides a clear, verifiable record of a portfolio's historical performance.

-   **Advanced Analytics and Optimization**: The `generate-advanced-portfolio-analytics-and-optimization-engine` function is a core feature that provides a detailed, multi-faceted report. This report includes core performance metrics, risk analysis (e.g., **Sharpe ratio**, **beta**), stress testing, and even AI-driven predictive insights and optimization recommendations. While some of the values in the provided code are placeholders, the function's structure demonstrates the contract's capacity for complex, on-chain financial analysis.

-   **Secure Asset Management**: The contract handles deposits (`deposit-to-portfolio`) and withdrawals (`withdraw-from-portfolio`) securely, ensuring that only the portfolio owner can manage their funds. All transactions are transparently recorded on the blockchain.

-   **Emergency Pause Mechanism**: The `contract-paused` variable provides a critical security measure, allowing the contract owner to halt all operations in an emergency, protecting user funds and preventing malicious activity.

-   **On-Chain Fees**: The contract includes a rebalancing fee (`rebalance-fee-percentage`) which is charged to the portfolio owner on rebalance and is transferred to the contract owner, providing a clear and transparent fee structure.

### Contract Functions

#### Public Functions

| Function Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `create-portfolio (strategy-type, risk-tolerance, initial-deposit, allocation-list)` | Creates a new portfolio for the caller with a defined strategy, risk tolerance, and initial asset allocation. |
| `deposit-to-portfolio (portfolio-id, amount)` | Allows a user to add more STX to an existing portfolio they own. |
| `trigger-rebalance (portfolio-id)` | Initiates a rebalance for a specified portfolio, adjusting asset allocations and charging a fee. Can only be called by the portfolio owner. |
| `withdraw-from-portfolio (portfolio-id, amount)` | Allows a user to withdraw STX from their portfolio. Fails if the requested amount exceeds the portfolio's total value. |
| `generate-advanced-portfolio-analytics-and-optimization-engine (...)` | Generates and logs a comprehensive report with performance analytics, risk metrics, stress testing, and optimization recommendations. Only callable by the portfolio owner. |

#### Private Functions

The contract relies on several private functions for internal calculations and validation. These are not directly accessible by users but are crucial for the contract's functionality and security.

-   **`calculate-allocation-value`**: Computes the value of a specific asset allocation within a portfolio based on its target percentage.

-   **`calculate-percentage`**: Determines the percentage of an amount relative to a total, handling division by zero.

-   **`validate-allocation-percentages`**: Ensures that the sum of all target percentages in a new portfolio's allocation list equals 100, preventing invalid configurations.

-   **`get-percentage`**: A helper function used within `validate-allocation-percentages` to extract the percentage value from an allocation object.

-   **`calculate-rebalance-fee`**: Computes the rebalancing fee based on a percentage of the portfolio's total value.

### Data Structures

#### Constants

-   `CONTRACT-OWNER`: The principal that deployed the contract and receives rebalancing fees.

-   `ERR-*`: A series of error codes for different failure conditions.

-   `MAX-ASSETS-PER-PORTFOLIO`: The maximum number of asset types a portfolio can hold.

-   `MIN-REBALANCE-INTERVAL`: The minimum time between rebalances in blocks.

-   `PRECISION-MULTIPLIER`: Used to maintain precision in calculations, particularly with percentages.

-   `MAX-ALLOCATION-PERCENTAGE`: A constant to ensure total allocations don't exceed 100%.

#### Variables

-   `next-portfolio-id`: A counter to ensure each new portfolio has a unique ID.

-   `total-managed-assets`: Tracks the total value of all assets managed by the contract.

-   `contract-paused`: A boolean flag for emergency pausing of the contract.

-   `rebalance-fee-percentage`: The fee charged for each rebalance.

#### Maps

-   `portfolios`: Stores detailed information about each portfolio, including owner, strategy, and current value.

-   `asset-allocations`: Records the target and current allocation percentages for each asset within a portfolio.

-   `portfolio-performance`: A map dedicated to tracking a portfolio's performance metrics, fees paid, and rebalance count.

-   `user-portfolios`: A list of portfolio IDs for each user, allowing for easy lookup and management.

### Usage

1.  **Create a Portfolio**: The user calls `create-portfolio` and specifies their strategy and initial asset allocation. The initial STX deposit is sent to the contract to begin managing.

2.  **Add Funds**: Users can add more funds to their portfolio at any time with `deposit-to-portfolio`.

3.  **Rebalance**: When a rebalance is needed, the portfolio owner calls `trigger-rebalance`. The contract deducts the rebalance fee and updates the portfolio's state.

4.  **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw their funds from the portfolio at any time using `withdraw-from-portfolio`.

5.  **Analyze Performance**: The `generate-advanced-portfolio-analytics-and-optimization-engine` function can be used to generate a detailed report, providing a comprehensive overview of the portfolio's health, risk, and potential for improvement.

### Code Architecture

The code is logically structured into sections for **constants**, **data maps and vars**, and **functions**. The use of private helper functions keeps the main public functions concise and readable. The extensive use of maps allows for efficient data retrieval and storage, enabling the tracking of multiple portfolios and their individual metrics.

### Security & Audits

The contract is designed with security in mind:

-   **Access Control**: All functions that modify a portfolio's state or retrieve sensitive information are protected by checks (`is-eq tx-sender owner`) to ensure only the owner can act on their portfolio.

-   **State Protection**: The `contract-paused` variable serves as a critical failsafe in an emergency.

-   **Input Validation**: `asserts!` are used throughout to validate inputs, such as ensuring a risk tolerance is within the valid range (1-10) and that allocation percentages sum to 100.

-   **Rebalance Throttling**: The `MIN-REBALANCE-INTERVAL` prevents users from excessively triggering rebalances, which could be costly or lead to network congestion.

While these measures are in place, a formal, independent security audit is highly recommended before deploying this contract on the mainnet.
